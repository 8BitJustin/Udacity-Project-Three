===============================

Good day (or evening)! Welcome to my version of the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree Arcade Game.
Below are both instructions on how to run the game and how to play the game.

# Run Instructions:
If you can dodge a wrench, you can run this game. Simply open the *Project Three - Arcade Game* folder, right click on *index.html*, select *Open with* and select your preferred browser. This will open up the game field within your browser.

# Play Instructions:
**For best experience, play with the console open (Ctrl+Shift+I for Chrome, F12 for IE, Ctrl+Shift+J for Firefox ... and select Console)**
The point of the game is to get to the river without being touched.
Starting at the bottom, use the arrow or ASDW keys to get to the river. Be careful, as the beetles will come at you at random speeds.
Every time you get to the river, you gain a point, and every five points, you change to a different character. But get touched by a beetle, and you lose all points.

Can you unlock the Princess Girl at 20 points?
