===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

Good day (or evening)! Welcome to my version of the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree Arcade Game.
Below are both instructions on how to run the game and how to play the game.

Run Instructions:
If you can dodge a wrench, you can run this game. Simply open the *Project Three - Arcade Game* folder, right click on *index.html*, select *Open with* and select your preferred browser. This will open up the game field within your browser.

Play Instructions:
**For best experience, play with the console open (Ctrl+Shift+I for Chrome, F12 for IE, Ctrl+Shift+J for Firefox ... and select Console)**
The point of the game is to get to the river without being touched.
